# project-notes-n-numbers
This is project 2, "notes n numbers" with html, css and javascript. 

Welcome to my project 2 titled "Numbers 'n Notes", a handy games night assistant.
The site has 3 main features all of which are easy to use and designed in a clear 
and concise manner. The games night assistant contains a random number generator, 
a notepad and a handy Day/Night mode toggle switch. The website is responsive so 
its even handy for using on the go on a mobile device.

The first feature is the random number generator (1-6)
The previous dice results are displayed below.

The second feature is the notepad. The user can input notes of various lengths and they will all appear 
promptly below the input area, for viewing.
The notes are displayed but can be double clicked to delete. The list can also be cleared by hitting the clear now button.

The third feature is a handy Day/Night mode which is a very popular feature now on lots of sites and apps.
